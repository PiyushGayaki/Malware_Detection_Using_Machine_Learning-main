# Malware_Detection_Using_Machine_Learning
The PE Malware Classifier is a powerful tool designed to analyze and classify Portable Executable (PE) files as either legitimate or potentially malicious. It uses machine learning techniques to extract relevant features, train a Random Forest Classifier model, and extract information from PE files.
The PE Malware Classifier is a machine learning-based project designed to analyze and classify Portable Executable (PE) files as either legitimate or potentially malicious. PE files are commonly used in Windows operating systems to store executable programs, DLLs, and system components.

This project provides a comprehensive solution for automating the analysis and classification of PE files, empowering security analysts, malware researchers, and system administrators to identify potential threats efficiently.

## Features
Dataset preprocessing: The project includes data preprocessing steps to remove irrelevant columns and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Feature selection: It utilizes the Extra Trees Classifier to identify the most important features for classification, ensuring optimal performance and reducing computational complexity.
Random Forest Classifier: The model is trained using the Random Forest Classifier algorithm, which is known for its ability to handle complex data and provide accurate predictions.
Performance evaluation: The trained model is evaluated on the testing set to measure its accuracy and performance in classifying PE files.
File analysis: The project provides functions to extract various information from PE files, such as file header details, section information, imports, exports, resources, and version information. These details contribute to creating a comprehensive feature set for classification.
Individual file classification: The PE Malware Classifier allows users to test individual PE files for their probability of being malware. It accepts a file as input and applies the trained model to classify it as either legitimate or potentially malicious.
Model persistence: The trained model can be saved and loaded using the joblib library, enabling seamless integration and reusability.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required packages: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, pefile, joblib

#### Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Usage
Prepare your PE file dataset in CSV format, ensuring that it contains the necessary columns.
#### Update the file path in the code to point to your dataset:

#### Run the project code to perform the following steps:
Dataset preprocessing
Feature selection
Model training and evaluation
PE file analysis and classification

#### After running the code, the model will be saved as model.pkl, and the selected features will be saved as features.pkl.
#### To classify individual PE files, use the checkFile() function in the pe_malware_classifier.py script. Pass the path of the PE file as an argument:
